Building
--------
The code can be compiled, unit tests run, and packaged into a .JAR file using Maven.

Additions to the specification
------------------------------
Accepts 3 optional command line arguments
- `--ansi` - use colored output on ANSI compatible terminals
- `--big` - play on a 15x12 board
- `--tiny` - play on a 5x5 board


Assumptions
-----------
- With no mention of what to do after a round, the program exits after a win
- The code requires no external libraries to run, but JUnit is required for tests
- It is written to show maintainable, extensible code rather than how I would implement it for a one-off or well-scoped project. So it has:
  - Interfaces with only one implementation
  - Methods that could be inlined, but exist for legibility
- The Java language level was kept low deliberately, avoiding lambdas, newer APIs etc.
